# Examples
Here is a list of examples:

<details>
    <summary>
        <h3>Hello world</h3>
    </summary>

```rust
fn main() {
    println("Hello, world!");
}
```
</details>

<br />

<details>
    <summary>
        <h3>Variables</h3>
    </summary>

The most common declaration:
```rust
let a = 5;
```

**ðŸš« This DOESN'T exist:**
```rust
let mut a = 5;
```

Let variables are mutable by default, so you don't have to specify it.
